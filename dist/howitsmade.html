      <h1 class="hero-title">How it’s made</h1>

      <p>Finally it’s done. I have spent quite a few hours on this project, thousand lines of code has been written and several litres of coffee been drank. I have created this website for a final year University subject, called Agency Ready. I set three
        different goals with this project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To show myself for potential employers.</li>
        <li>To practice the industry standards.</li>
        <li>To get a good mark.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I have started with an initial research to get a feel, how a professional portfolio looks like, then I have created a list of my aims. I have found <a href="http://www.vitosalvatore.com/" target="_blank">Vito Salvatore</a> and <a href="http://cihadturhan.com/"
        target="_blank">Cihad Turhan</a> particularly inspiring. Thus I got a notebook and a pen to develop my own ideas. As a beginner, I don’t have a massive, stunning collection of my works, therefore I chose to put emphasis on my hard & soft skills
        and my personality. I also wanted to show, what challenges I have faced on each project and what did I learn.</p>
      <p>The next step was to create a persona for my website. This persona is a fictional person with real characteristics (in my case it was Mike, the digital talent manager). It helped me to develop a typical user journey and got me one step closer to
        sketch up my initial wireframes.</p>
      <p>I chose to create my wireframes with Axure RP tool, as it was a perfect occasion to learn the software with a relatively simple website like this. Axure is an incredibly powerful tool to create interactive, clickable prototypes and wireframes rapidly.
        As I am shifting towards UX design more and more, this tool is essential in my future pathway.</p>
      <p>I have created a basic style guide that helps to understand how the website is visually put together. I have included all the font faces and contrasting colours that I planned to use on the website.</p>
      <p>After the style guide, I have written the entire content for the website. It was an important step, because it has made much easier the coding phase. I am not the best when it comes to writing, but I have tried to prioritise my skills and experiences
        gained in my former employments and University projects.</p>
      <p>I found a brilliant article from <a href="https://lmjabreu.com/post/why-and-how-to-avoid-hamburger-menus/" title="Why and how to avoid hamburger menus" target="_blank"> Luis Abreu: Why And How To Avoid Hamburger Menus. </a> Essentially, what’s out
        of the sight is out of mind. It means, anything that’s hidden behind the hamburger will be forgotten. This article has inspired me to think over my mobile navigation and get rid of the ‘evil’ hamburger button.</p>
      <p>I was not allowed to use any CSS frameworks at coding, therefore I have chosen to use the flexbox model for the spine of my layout. Due to an earlier successful implementation, it was very easy and straightforward to use this time as well. It was
        very handy when I had to write my media queries for mobile devices.</p>
      <p>I have created 4 breakpoints in my design, they were not predefined, I had to adjust them to my content. I used <a href="http://mqtest.io/" target="_blank" title="Identify your breakpoints with mqtest"> MQtest </a> to identify the breakpoints. It
        is a simple online tool that tells what is the current width and height of your browser, thus it is easier to find the breakpoints.</p>
      <p>After I have finished with the styling, it was time to do some Post CSS. I was using a loads of new CSS3 features in my code without vendor prefixes, therefore I had to run <a href="http://pleeease.io/play/" target="_blank">http://pleeease.io/play/</a> through
        my code. This clever cross-browser CSS tool inserts the missing prefixes and provides fallback for rem units.</p>
      <p>As a final step I have tested my webpage with different users & devices and made the necessary adjustments where I had to.</p>
      <p>If I could start again my project, I would definitely build it on SASS with mobile first approach. These tools would result much cleaner code and better CSS without any doubt.</p>
