      <h2 class="title">About the project</h2>
      <p>I had a Website Design unit in the second year of my University studies. We had to form groups of five people. Our task was to completely rebuild the department’s website. We have applied agile scrum project management methodology. We had regular
        sprint meetings with our clients (tutors). During the project, we have also used some fundamental UX tools. Our lo-fi wireframes were made with AXURE RP, we conducted card sorting and created personas with user journeys. When the website was ready,
        we tested it with different users, then refined it based on the user feedbacks. The user testing was really practical, as we could get first-hand information from the potential users.</p>

      <h2 class="title">Challenges</h2>
      <p>When we came up with a final wireframe idea, I started to code the website. Due to the fact, that we were not allowed to use frameworks, and the card layout of the main page, I decided to use flexbox. From an earlier project I had a basic understanding
        of this tool, but this website was much bigger with more possible issues. With few hours coding and researching I could overcome the problems and create the basic layout of the website. The biggest challenge was the implementation of the Twitter
        feed on the main page. I have spent significant amount of time on the solution, and I found a clever script that implements Twitter feed on any website, which turned out later on, it was not the best idea, because the website has created too many
        html request. Next time I have to combine my .css and .js assets into one file. Lesson learned.
